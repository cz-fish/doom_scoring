doom_scoring
============

Project goal:
Create extension pk3 (or wad) to add arcade-style player scoring to Doom (gzdoom) without modifying the game binary, IWADs or PWADs. When zdoom is run with this additional pk3, in-game scoring should work out-of-the-box with all maps. In cooperative mode, every player will see the entire scoreboard and be able to compare their current score with others.
